# Playground

After you've built the SDK at root, you can `cd` to this folder and run the playground applications with:

```
npm run dev
```

which will run a `vite` server on localhost (default port: 3000).

Browse to the provided local URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/`) and select a playground app to use.
