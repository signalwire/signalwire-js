# P4-004: Update Playground Examples - Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Updated Fabric Examples to Use @signalwire/browser-js
- **fabric/index.js**: Updated to import `SignalWire` from `@signalwire/browser-js`
- **fabric-callee/index.js**: Updated to import `SignalWire` from `@signalwire/browser-js`
- **fabric-http/index.js**: Updated to import `SignalWire` from `@signalwire/browser-js`

### 2. Verified Video SDK Examples Use @signalwire/js
- **video/index.js**: Correctly imports `Video` from `@signalwire/js`
- **chat/index.js**: Correctly imports `Chat` from `@signalwire/js`
- **pubSub/index.js**: Updated to import `PubSub` from `@signalwire/js` (was importing `Chat as PubSub`)
- **videoManager/index.js**: Correctly imports `Video` from `@signalwire/js`

### 3. Special Case: buildVideoElement
- In `fabric/index.js`, `buildVideoElement` is kept from `@signalwire/js` as it's part of the Video SDK

## Changes Made
1. All Fabric SDK examples now import from `@signalwire/browser-js`
2. All Video SDK examples continue to import from `@signalwire/js`
3. Fixed incorrect import in pubSub example
4. Clear separation of concerns achieved

## Build Issue Note
The playground build currently fails due to a separate issue with the js package build incorrectly trying to import interface types as runtime values. This is not related to the playground updates but rather a build configuration issue that needs to be addressed separately.

## Files Modified
1. `internal/playground-js/src/fabric/index.js`
2. `internal/playground-js/src/fabric-callee/index.js`
3. `internal/playground-js/src/fabric-http/index.js`
4. `internal/playground-js/src/pubSub/index.js`
