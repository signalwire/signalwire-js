# @signalwire/browser-common

The SignalWire Browser Common package contains shared browser components and utilities used by both the Video SDK (`@signalwire/js`) and the Call Fabric SDK (`@signalwire/browser-js`).

**Important**: This package is intended for internal use by the SignalWire browser SDKs. You should not use it directly in your production projects, as the APIs can and will change often. Usage of this package directly is currently not supported.

- **Client Infrastructure**: WebSocket and JWT session management
- **Room Components**: Device management and screen sharing capabilities
- **Media Utilities**: Video element building and overlay management
