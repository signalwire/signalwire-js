   * Makes an outbound Call and waits until it has been answered or hung up.
   * This is an advanced method that lets you call multiple devices in parallel
   * or series: for simpler use cases, see {@link dialPhone} and
   * {@link dialSip}.
   *
   * With this method you can specify a configuration of devices to call in
   * series and/or in parallel: as soon as one device answers the call, the
   * returned promise is resolved. You specify a configuration through a
   * {@link VoiceDeviceBuilder} object.
   *
   * @example Calls a phone number. If the number doesn't answer within 30
   * seconds, calls two different SIP endpoints in parallel.
   *
   * ```js
   * const devices = new Voice.DeviceBuilder()
   *   .add(Voice.DeviceBuilder.Phone({ from: '+XXXXXX', to: '+YYYYYY', timeout: 30 }))
   *   .add([
   *     Voice.DeviceBuilder.Sip({ from: 'sip:aaa@bbb.cc', to: 'sip:xxx@yyy.zz' }),
   *     Voice.DeviceBuilder.Sip({ from: 'sip:aaa@bbb.cc', to: 'sip:ppp@qqq.rr' })
   *   ])
   *
   * try {
   *   const call = await client.dial(devices)
   *   console.log("Call answered")
   * } catch (e) {
   *   console.log("Call not answered")
   * }
   * ```

   *
   * @returns A call object.
