- Added `state` param to `CallingCallCollectEventParams`
- Made sure `voiceCallCollectWorker` doesn't clean up `CallCollect` instance and emit `ended`/`failed` event if the `state` is `"collecting"`
- Resolve `CallCollect.ended()` promise only when `state` is NOT `"collecting"` AND `final` is either `undefined`/`true` AND `result.type` is one of `ENDED_STATES`
- Added more test cases for `Call.collect()` in `@sw-internal/e2e-realtime-api`
