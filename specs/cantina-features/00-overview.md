# Cantina Features Extraction - Specifications Overview

## Executive Summary

This directory contains detailed technical specifications for features extracted from the Cantina App PR #1509 (https://github.com/signalwire/cantina/pull/1509) to be implemented in the @signalwire/client SDK. These features represent significant improvements in call stability, device management, and user experience that were originally added to the legacy Cantina application.

## Background

The Cantina App is a real-time conference web application built by SignalWire using an outdated version of the platform and SDK. Since the legacy SDK couldn't be modified, these features were implemented directly in the application layer. This extraction project aims to incorporate these proven features into the modern @signalwire/client SDK.

## Specifications Overview

### 1. Device Preference Management (01-device-preference-management.md)

**Key Benefits:**

- Eliminates "device not found" errors
- Maintains call continuity when devices change
- Preserves user preferences across sessions

### 2. WebRTC Stats Monitoring (02-webrtc-stats-monitoring.md)

**Priority: HIGH**

- Integration with WebRTC Stats Monitor

**Key Benefits:**

- Automatic recovery from network interruptions
- Reduced call drops due to connectivity issues
- Graceful degradation to relay-only connections

### 4. Visibility & Lifecycle Management (04-visibility-lifecycle-management.md)

**Priority: MEDIUM**

- Intelligent handling of tab focus changes
- Mobile-specific auto-mute/unmute behavior
- Device re-enumeration on focus gain
- Video recovery strategies for wake events

**Key Benefits:**

- Resource conservation on mobile devices
- Seamless recovery from sleep/wake cycles
- Improved battery life on mobile

### 5. Mobile Fullscreen Features (05-mobile-fullscreen-features.md)

**Priority: MEDIUM**

- Auto-fullscreen on landscape orientation
- Manual fullscreen controls for mobile
- Fake fullscreen fallback for unsupported browsers
- Picture-in-Picture conflict resolution

**Key Benefits:**

- Enhanced mobile viewing experience
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Intuitive orientation-based behavior

### 6. Network Quality Tracking (06-network-quality-tracking.md)

**Priority: MEDIUM**

- Real-time quality score calculation
- Historical metrics tracking
- User-facing quality indicators
- Integration with stats monitoring

**Key Benefits:**

- User awareness of call quality
- Data-driven troubleshooting
- Proactive issue communication

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-3)

1. **Device Preference Management** - Foundation for device handling
2. **WebRTC Stats Monitoring** - Core monitoring infrastructure
3. **Network Quality Tracking** - Quality metrics and state management

### Phase 2: Recovery Systems (Weeks 4-5)

1. **Automatic Reinvite System** - Network recovery mechanisms
2. **Visibility & Lifecycle Management** - Tab/focus recovery

### Phase 3: User Experience (Week 6)

1. **Mobile Fullscreen Features** - Mobile UX enhancements
2. Integration testing and polish

## Integration Points

All specifications are designed to integrate with:

- **BaseRoomSession** - Core session management
- **FabricRoomSession** - Call Fabric SDK specific features
- **VideoRoomSession** - Video SDK specific features
- **RTCPeer.js** - WebRTC peer connection management
- **Redux/Saga Workers** - Event handling and side effects

## Dependencies

### External Libraries

- `screenfull` - Fullscreen API wrapper
- Existing SignalWire SDK dependencies

### Browser APIs

- MediaDevices API
- Page Visibility API
- Fullscreen API
- Picture-in-Picture API
- WebRTC Statistics API

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics

- > 95% device recovery success rate
- > 80% network issue recovery on first attempt
- <5 second recovery time for standard issues
- > 90% code coverage for new features

### User Experience Metrics

- Reduced call drops by >50%
- Improved mobile experience ratings
- Decreased support tickets for device/network issues
- Increased average call duration

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

1. **Browser Compatibility** - Mitigated with polyfills and fallbacks
2. **Performance Impact** - Mitigated with efficient monitoring intervals
3. **Breaking Changes** - Mitigated with backward compatibility layer
4. **Mobile Limitations** - Mitigated with platform-specific handling

## Testing Strategy

Each specification includes comprehensive testing approaches:

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for SDK integration
- E2E tests for real-world scenarios
- Performance tests for monitoring impact
- Device matrix testing for compatibility

## Documentation Requirements

Each feature will require:

- API reference documentation
- Migration guides from current SDK
- Best practices guide
- Troubleshooting documentation
- Example implementations

## Timeline

Total estimated implementation time: 6-8 weeks

- Core features: 3-4 weeks
- Recovery systems: 2 weeks
- UX enhancements: 1 week
- Testing & documentation: 1-2 weeks

## Conclusion

These specifications represent a significant enhancement to the SignalWire SDK's reliability and user experience. By extracting proven features from the Cantina app, we can provide developers with robust tools for building resilient real-time communication applications.

The modular design allows for incremental implementation while maintaining backward compatibility. Each feature has been designed to work independently while providing additional benefits when used together.
